#### Step 2: Customize CSS Menu

Our menu will be a simple list, so let‚Äôs take the reactjs-popup home page menu and use it as an example.

As you see this menu is a simple ul element, nothing special.

#### Step 3:integrate all stuff with reactjs-popup

All we need to do in this part is to import the reactjs-popup component and set the burger menu as a trigger prop for the popup component and the menu as the popup children. simple, is it ? magic !!

Thanks to the ‚Äòfunction as a children pattern‚Äô the trigger can access to the popup state easily. we need also to pass props to the burger component like the following.

Adding some custom css and this is the final result.
