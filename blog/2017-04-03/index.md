I recently worked through a short tutorial about creating simple tooltips using pure CSS (and no additional HTML element or JavaScript). I later used this technique in my own project, and figured out some tricks to improve upon it.

This article is a step-by-step tutorial that will help you understand these CSS  tricks so you can make pure-CSS tooltips, too.

By the end of this post, you‚Äôll know how to add a tooltip to any element by adding a simple attribute.

### The problem

I needed to create a custom tooltip for my project.

I started off by Googling ‚ÄúCSS Tooltip Generator.‚Äù I found quite a few generators. Their approach was to add a span with an absolute position inside the element you want a tooltip for.

But I already had an otherwise-complete project. I didn‚Äôt want to go back through and add all these span elements throughout my project. This would take time and will complicate my HTML. There had to be a better way.

At last, I found an amazing tutorial on YouTube about tooltips. The smart trick it used was to create a tooltip using the `:: before`  and `:: after`  CSS selectors. You can watch the video  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4lQwiUvGlY&t=157s).

This trick is was smart and clean, but it wasn‚Äôt generic enough.

### Improving upon the solution

In this part, I‚Äôll make this trick more generic and we‚Äôll discover more about some CSS properties. Here‚Äôs what we ultimately want to be able to do:

<button tooltip=‚Äùtooltip content here‚Äù> click here !! </button>

Not only that, but we want to be able to specify the tooltip position easily:

<button tooltip=‚Äùtooltip content here‚Äù tooltip-position=‚Äùleft‚Äù > click here !! </button>

First‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääas mentioned in the video‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe‚Äôll add a  `before`  and an  `after`  pseudo element to the button.

`::after`  and `::before`  are pseudo-elements, which allow you to insert content onto a page from CSS before or after the content of the element. They work like this:

div::after {
 content: ‚Äúafter‚Äù;
}
div::before {
 content: ‚Äúbefore‚Äù;
}

The result looks something like this:

<div>
 before
 <!-- div content here -->
 after
</div>

### Let‚Äôs walk through this step-by-step

**Step 1:** we‚Äôll add a tooltip attribute like this:

<button tooltip=‚Äùsimple tooltip here‚Äù> click Me !! </button>

We need `::after`  and `::before`  pseudo-elements. These will be a simple rectangle with the content of the tooltip. We create a simple rectangle with CSS by adding a border around an empty element that we create with the  `content`  property.

The `::before`  pseudo-element is used to show the tooltip content. We add it with the property  `content`  and extract the tooltip attribute value. The value for content can be a string, an attribute value from the element like our example, or even an image with  `url(path/image.png)`.

To make this work, the button element‚Äôs position must be relative. In other words, the position of all elements inside the button is relative to the position of the button element itself.

We add also some position tricks to make the tooltip in the center with the transform property and this the result.

Here‚Äôs our CSS:

**Step 2:**  we just play with the `::before`  and `::after`  pseudo-elements to create a tooltip position. Our button HTML will look like this:

<button tooltip=‚Äùtooltip here‚Äù tooltip-position=‚Äùleft‚Äù> click here !! </button>


The tooltip-position can be: right, left, top, or bottom.

**step 3**: in this final step, we will add a simple hover animation to the tooltip.
