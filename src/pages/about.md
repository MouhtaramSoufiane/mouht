## 👶 How I got where we are now

I was born in Casablanaca, a large town in the Atlantic coast of Morocco. I grew up in Casablnca and went to high school there. I studied Computer Science at the Faculty of Sciences in Casablanca and now I am Master's degree in Distributed Systems and Artificial Intelligence.

## 👀 Interests

I mainly like spending my time on one of the following:

- **🚶 Walking or Running**: Walking through the neighborhood or running while listening to an audio book/podcast or maybe music (depending on the mood 😀) is a daily habit for me.

- **🎥 Watching YouTube**: I am somewhat addicted to YouTube and can't stop watching videos about tech, software development, psychology and human behavior. check [Youtube channels](/uses#-youtube-channels) for recommendations

- **📚 Reading**: Not a lot, but I enjoy reading anything related to psychology and human behavior. You can check my top five books on the [Uses page](/uses#-books).

- **⚽️ Playing And Watching Soccer**: Playing soccer is one of my favorite hobbies and playing a game every week with friends is a must for me. I also enjoy watching soccer matches, especially the Real Madrid ones.
