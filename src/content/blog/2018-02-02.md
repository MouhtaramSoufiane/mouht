> This article is about giving you a simple overview of what you can do with reactjs-popup and how to use it effectively.

Today, we are excited to announce reactjs-popup 1.0.

[Reactjs-popup](https://react-popup.elazizi.com/) is a simple and very small (3 kb) react popup component, with multiple use cases.
we created reactjs-popup to create a color picker for our project [picsrush](https://picsrush.com/) a new online image editor. After a while, We decided to make it available for everyone in GitHub and npm repository.

**Why do you need to choose reactjs\*\***-\***\*popup over all other implementation?**

- Built with react fragment that’s mean no additional wrapper Divs in your code or in the trigger element. 😮
- Does not inject HTML outside your app root. 📦
- Function as children pattern to take control over your popup anywhere in your code. 💪
- Modal, Tooltip, Menu, Toast(coming soon) : All in one component🏋️
- Full style customization. 👌
- Easy to use. 🚀
- All these clocks in at around 3 kB zipped. ⚡️
- Animation (coming soon).
