Itis a long time that I am a big fan of chris fideo the author of [servers for hackers](https://serversforhackers.com/) ,one of the most rich source of content to learn server’s configurations , security ,database,docker and much more DevOps topics.

[**Dockerizing your Application**](https://serversforhackers.com/dockerized-app) is one of the amazing free course, it’s a step-by-step docker workflow to develop a breeze for your application. According to Chris,Vessel is the result of this docker workflow more is an official that everyone could easily use.

> **Let’s give it a try**

Vessel is a lightweight docker environment for Laravel, that means it is just a small set of files that set up a local docker development environment per project and there is no extra thing to install globally, expect Docker system itself.

### Install Docker and Docker-compose

Docker is an open source project based on Linux container, if you are not familiar yet with docker, this article “ [**A Beginner-Friendly Introduction to Containers, VMs and Docker**](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-beginner-friendly-introduction-to-containers-vms-and-docker-79a9e3e119b) ” by [Preethi Kasireddy](https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy) is the ideal place to take your first step.

At this moment Vessel only works on Mac and Linux because it uses a bash script to run Docker commands.

For Linux Ubuntu distribution the easiest way to install docker is by the following:

```sh
curl -fsSL get.docker.com | sudo sh
sudo usermod -aG docker your-user // add your user to docker group
```

To Install docker compose run this command to download the latest version :

```sh
sudo curl -L [https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.17.0/docker-compose-`uname](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.17.0/docker-compose-%60uname) -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Next,Apply executable permissions to the binary.

```sh
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Learn more about docker installation : [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) , [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Get Started with Vessel

First you need to create a Laravel project to start with by the following :

```sh
composer create-project — prefer-dist laravel/laravel vessel_test
```

Now and as I mention before Vessel is lightweight docker environment includes a Laravel service provider that makes easy and simple to start your own development setup. All you need to do in order to start your dev setup with vessel :

_# Install Vessel into your project_

```sh
composer require shipping-docker/vessel
```

_# Publish the `vessel` command and Docker files_

```sh
php artisan vendor:publish — provider=”Vessel\VesselServiceProvider”
```

_# Run this once to initialize project_
_# Must run with “bash” until initialized_

```sh
bash vessel init
```

The first time you start up an application with Vessel using the init command, vessel will download the following official Docker images:

- PHP 7.1
- MySQL 5.7
- Redis
- NodeJS with NPM, Yarn, and Gulp

Start vessel by running :

```sh
cd vessel_test
./vessel start
```

Head to [http://localhost](http://localhost/) in your browser and see your Laravel site!

And at last, also Vessel has good documentation that covers everything you need to know to get started : [official documentation](https://vessel.shippingdocker.com/)
