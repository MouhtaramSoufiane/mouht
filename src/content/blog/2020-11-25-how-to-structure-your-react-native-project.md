As I have been writing tutorials about react native in the last couple of months, people usually ask me about the best way to structure a react native project to make it clean, scalable, and easy to follow for newcomers developers.

In the following post, I will share an easy, clean, and scalable project structure ready to use for your next React Native project.

I need to mention that the approach reflects how we use React native in our Obytes mobile team.

Before I start talking about project structure, I would love to share some essential ideas you should consider for a good react native project structure.

### Use Typescript

I start working with typescript for react-native a year ago. I would see that using typescript is super useful to help write clean and secure code. Still, itâ€™s a little bit confusing in the first days as I found myself dealing with typing more than application logic, but after that, I canâ€™t see myself creating a new project without typescript. So make sure to give a try and check those amazing [Cheatsheets for experienced React developers getting started with TypeScript](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react); you can thank me later :)

### Setup Husky pre-commit hook with ESLint

Husky lets us run commands or scripts before committing or pushing our code to git. Itâ€™s beneficial to set up some pre-commit hook easily. We usually use it to run Eslint and Prettier to validate changed files typing before commit.

Install deps :

```bash
yarn add husky lint-staged
```

Add the following config to the package.json file.

```json
// package.json
"husky": {
   "hooks": {
     "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
   }
 },
 "lint-staged": {
   "*.{js,jsx,tsx}": "eslint"
 }
```

### Setup module-resolver for easy import

During your journey of writing clean and reusable code, for sure, you are going to use `import x for "file"` statement, and as you code source grow, you will find yourself writing import some wired import statement like the following:

```ts
import foo from "../.../../folder/foo";
```

The best way to make your code clean in such cases is to use absolute import.
To start using absolute import in your project, you need to update `baseUrl` config inside the `tsconfig.json` configuration file to `./src`.
Aso you will need to use the module-resolver babel plugin to update the resolver root folder for babel like the following:

```js
// babel.config.js

module.exports = {
  presets: ["module:metro-react-native-babel-preset"],
  plugins: [
    "module:react-native-dotenv",
    [
      "module-resolver",
      {
        root: ["./src"],
        extensions: [
          ".ios.ts",
          ".android.ts",
          ".ts",
          ".ios.tsx",
          ".android.tsx",
          ".tsx",
          ".jsx",
          ".js",
          ".json",
        ],
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

As we agree on those points we can jump now to how to structure your react native project.

## Project structure

The is a real folder tree of a React Native application `src` folder i recommend to follow:

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ api
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ usePosts.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ core
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Auth
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ I18n
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ navigation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AuthNavigator.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ NavigationContainer.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RootNavigator.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TabNavigator.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ screens
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Home
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Login
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ translations
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ en.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ar.json
â””â”€â”€ ui
    â”œâ”€â”€ Button.tsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ ErrorHandler
    â”œâ”€â”€ Form.tsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ Icon.tsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ Input.tsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ Screen.tsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ Text.tsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ Toast.tsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ View.tsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx
    â””â”€â”€ theme
```

You can think of this as modules for our mobile app and every module include an application related files :

- `ui` : in the `ui` folder we create our design system and all common components and theme configuration based on [restyle](https://github.com/Shopify/restyle) and [react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg) for icons.
- `core`: this folder is useful for any Provider and general concepts( a folder that you can easily copy-paste between projects). here, we put our Auth, localization...
- `translations`: translations files
- `navigation`: all navigation-related components ( Stacks, Tabs ....)
- `api` : this folder will contain all api related hooks created using `apollo-client` or `react-query` depend on the backend implementation.
- `screens`: a folder for applications screens, we usually create a new folder for every screen or application module, and for every screen folder, you should see a components folder where we create screen components.

A little trick that deserves to be mentioned here is that every module above will have a root index file that exports all components and functions from the entire folder tree, which makes importing components very clean.

Example of ui index folder :

```ts
//ui/index.js
export * from "./theme";
export * from "./View";
export * from "./Text";
export * from "./Button";
export * from "./Screen";
export * from "./Input";
export * from "./Form";
export * from "./ErrorHandler";
export * from "./icons";
```

Example of a screen Home:

```ts
// screens/Home/index.tsx
import React from "react";
import { Button, Screen, Text, View } from "ui";
import { API } from "@env";
import { translate, useAuth } from "core";

export const Home = () => {
  const { signOut } = useAuth();
  return (
    <Screen>
      <View flex={1} justifyContent="center">
        <Text variant="header" textAlign="center">
          {translate("name")}
        </Text>
        <Text variant="body" textAlign="center">
          This is An ENV Var : {API}
        </Text>
        <Button label="LogOut" onPress={signOut} />
      </View>
    </Screen>
  );
};
```

As you can see all ideas we discuss in this post help us create clean screen components.

## Bonus

What if i told you that you can benefit from those tricks and project structure ideas using a command-line tool,
Well, recently we create an [Obytes react native template](https://github.com/obytes/react-native-template-obytes) based on Obytes mobile tribe best practices and come with the following features :

âœ… Typescript by default based on official Typescript template <br/>
âœ… Generate App Icon and Splash screen<br/>
âœ… React Navigation Pre-installed<br/>
âœ… Auth flow with sensitive-info to secure tokens<br/>
âœ… A clean project structure based on this blog post.<br/>
âœ… Minimal UI kit setup using restyle and configurable theme & icons using react-native-svg<br/>
âœ… A good approach to handle forms based on react-hook-form<br/>
âœ… A complete setup to Handle Errors<br/>
âœ… Handel environment variables with react-native-env<br/>
âœ… Localization<br/>

And you can use it as a template for react-native cli.

```sh
npx react-native init MyApp --template https://github.com/obytes/react-native-template-obytes
```

Make sure to give it a try and help us improve the template.

I hope you found that interesting, informative, and entertaining. I would be more than happy to hear your remarks and thoughts about this solution in The comments.
