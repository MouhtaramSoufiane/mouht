# Summary

This book‚Äôs idea is a question that keeps jumping to the hand of the author, and he will write a book to answer it. The question is: How do people end up loving what they do?

The author will try to answer this question in 4 rules:

## Rule 1: don't follow your passion

Everyone talks about passion: books, magazines, and celebrities, and they convince people that somewhere there's a magic 'right' job waiting for them.

Starting from Steve Jobs's story on building Apple companies and more stories about successful people enjoying their work. The author begins to demonstrate that following your passion is not the key to love your career or success.

Based on research on workplaces satisfaction there is tree conclusion :

- Career passions are rare
- Passion takes time: more experience = more passion
- Passion is a side effect of Mastery

To love your Job You should have:

- Autonomy: the feeling that you have control over your day and that your actions are important
- Competence: the feeling that you are good at what you do
- The sense of connection to other people.

You will find some successful people who claimed they were passionate about their childhood work (sports player, actors). Observing a few instances of a strategy working does not make it universally effective. The vast majority of people don't have pre-existing passions waiting to be discovered and matched to a job.

## Rule 2: the importance of skills: be so good they can't ignore you.

The craftsman mindset focuses on what you can offer to the world. The passion mindset instead focuses on what the world can provide you with.

When you focus only on what your work offers you. It makes you hyperaware of what you don't like about it. leading to chronic unhappiness

To follow the craftsman mindset, simply focus on becoming so good they can't ignore you, approach your work as a true performer, you adopt the craftsman mindset first, and then the passion follows.

The economic theory tells us that if you want something that's both rare and valuable, you need something rare and valuable to offer in return. You can think of those rare and valuable skills as your career capital.

The craftsman mindset is a well-suited strategy for acquiring career capital; this is why it trumps the passion mindset if you're goal is to create work you love.

The passion mindset is not just ineffective for creating work you love. In many cases, it can actively work against this goal, sometimes with devastating consequences.

Be aware of the three disqualifiers traits for applying the craftsman mindset to jobs :

- The job presents few opportunities. Distinguish yourself by developing relevant skills. Those are rare and valuable.
- The job focuses on something. You think useless or perhaps even actively bad for the world.
- The job forced you to work with people you really dislike.

### Becoming a craftsman

To successfully adopt the craftsman mindset, we have to approach our jobs with a dedication to deliberate practice.

Deliberate practice is not repeating some things over and over. Still, you need to stretch your ability over time and receive immediate feedback about your practice to resolve your issues ASAP.

The five habits of a craftsman:

#### Step 1: Decide what capital market you're in :

- Winner takes all: there's only one type of career capital available and many different people competing for it: scriptwriter as an example.
- Auction: less structured, there are many different career capital types, and each person might generate a unique collection.

#### Step 2: Identify your capital type

Identify the skills to build, or you need to be good at

#### Step 3: Define " Good":

define what good means for your skills, and make sure to set clear goals

#### Step 4: Stretch and destroy

Don't stick at an "acceptable level" or your comfort zone, stretch your ability every time you feel comfortable, and receive honest feedback even if it destroys what you thought was Good.

#### Step 5: be patient

Acquiring new skills can take time, be patient. ü§ó

## RULE #3 Turn down a promotion: the importance of control

Control is having a say in what you do and how you do it. Giving people more control over what you do and how they do it Increase their happiness, engagement, and sense of fulfillment. But you need to avoid those two traps of control.

- Control that's acquired without career capital is not sustainable. You need career capital first.
- The point at which you have acquired enough career capital to get meaningful control over your working life is exactly when you have become valuable enough to your current employer that they will try to prevent you from making the change.

### Do what people are willing to pay for :

when deciding whether to follow on an appealing pursuit that will introduce more control into your work-life, seek evidence of whether people are willing to pay for it. You find this evidence; continue. If not, move on. Hobbies are exempt from this rule.

It isn‚Äôt about making money. Instead, it's about using money as a " neutral indicator of value‚Äù. This is the law of financial viability.

## Rule 4: Think small, act big: the importance of a mission

Mission provides a unifying goal for your career. Still, It‚Äôs important to acquire career capital before start talking about your mission.

For a mission-driven project to succeed, it should be remarkable in two different ways; first, it must compel people who encounter it to remark about it to others. Second, it must be launched in a venue that supports such remarking.

To succeed in your mission, you should focus on little bets ( small projects) to gain significant wins towards your mission.

Use the idea of the adjacent possible, which is the origin of innovation because the next big idea in any field is typically found right beyond the current cutting edge, in the adjacent space that contains the possible new combinations of existing ideas.
