# Summary

The author starts his book by telling his own story—an accident in high school and how it changes his life.

James started practicing some small habits to help him with his college challenges; those simple habits enabled him to be one of the most rewarded students over the upcoming three years.

From this point, James starts his blog in 2012 and start writing about habit new posts every week; right now, his blog is receiving millions of visitors each month.

## Introduction

- Habits are critical in your life and are a double-edged sword; they can work for you or against you.
- Habit is the compound interest of self-improvement.
- You need to be patient; the most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed.
- An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system.
- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
- Focus on systems over Goals; Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

## Your habits shape your identity.

There are three levels of change.

- Outcome change: based on goals and achievements
- Process change: based on systems
- Identify change: based on changing your beliefs about how you are

The most effective way to change your habits is to focus on identity change: who you wish to become over what you want to achieve.

Your identity emerges out of your habits, and becoming the best version of yourself requires you to edit your beliefs and upgrade and expand your identity continuously.

## The philosophy behind Habits & habit Feedback loop

A habit is behavior the has been repeated enough times to become automatic. The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve life’s problems with as little energy and effort as possible.

**The four steps for the habit Feedback loop are cue, craving, response, and reward.**

Example :

- Cue: your phone buzzes with a new text message
- Craving: you want to learn the contents of the message.
- Response: you grab your phone and read the text
- Reward: you satisfy your craving to read the message.

> Grabbing your phone become associated with your phone buzzing

Understanding the habits feedback loop will help us change our habits and behavior using the four laws corresponding to every habit Feedback loop step.

1. Make it obvious - Make it invisible - (cue)
2. Make it attractive - Make it unattractive - (craving)
3. Make it easy - Make it difficult - (response)
4. Make it satisfying - Make it unsatisfying - (reward)

#### How to Know your habits

The process of behavior change always starts from awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change. One of the best ways to know your habits is to create a Habits scorecard to collect all your daily habits to become more aware of your behavior.

Pointing and calling can help also increase your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions.

## 1st law of Behavior change: Make it obvious (cues)

There are two common cues: time and location.

To create an implementation intention, you should set the specific time and location : I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]

Also, one of the essential strategies to build a habit is using habit stack when you can use to pair a new habit with a current one: After [CURRENT HABIT] I will [ NEW HABIT]

#### Environment often matter :

- Small changes in context (environment) can lead to large changes in behavior, and every habit is initiated by a cue which more likely to be around us.
- For good habits, make sure to make the cues obvious in your environment as your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding your behavior.
- It always easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old ones.
- You can invert the 1st law of Behavior change to make it invisible if you want to eliminate bad habits, which means try to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.
- Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.

## 2nd law of Behavior change: Make it attractive

Habits are dopamine-driven feedbacks loop. When dopamine rise, so does our motivation to act as it is the anticipation of a reward - not the fulfillment of it- that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.

You can use the Temptations bundling strategy to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do. Example: After i do ten burpees, i will check Facebook

#### Impact of environment

We usually tend to imitate the habit of three social groups: the close( family and friends ), the many ( the tribe), and the powerful ( those with status and prestige: boss, celebrities...). Those social groups determine which behavior are attractive to us, and we try to adopt the group’s habits because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.

One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.

The inversion of the 2nd law of Behavior change is making it unattractive. One strategy to make a bad habit seem unattractive is to highlight the benefits of avoiding it.

Habits are attractive when we associated them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative emotions.

## 3rd law of Behavior change: Make it easy ( action)

- we should understand that the most effective form of learning is practice and not planing which means you need to focus on action over motion.
- The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.
- We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of effort; this is the law of least effort for human behavior.
- you should reduce frictions associated with a good habit and increase friction for bad ones
- Prime your environment to make future actions easier. ( Unplug the television and take the batteries out of the remote after each use, so it takes an extra ten seconds to turn it back on)

#### 2 minutes rule

The idea is to standardize before you optimize. You can't improve a habit that doesn't exist. So you can practice your new habit repetitive for 2 minutes at the beginning of a new process and more likely to gain this new habit as you can improve it gradually.

- Use a commitment device to force your future self to the right action; A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future.
- Use onetime choices - like buying a better mattress or enrolling automatic savings plan to automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.
- Use technology to automate your habit is one of the most reliable and effective ways to guarantee the right behavior.

The inversion of the 3rd law of Behavior change is to make it difficult.

## 4th law of Behavior change: Make it satisfying

As human behavior, we value the president more than the future ( immediate return environment). What is immediately rewarded is repeated, and what is immediately punished is avoided. Still, our world and the goals we want to achieve now a day are delayed ( delayed return environment).

The best way to train yourself to delay gratification. It's instead a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run, and a little bit of immediate pain to one that doesn’t

As a human, one of the most satisfying feelings is making progress; you can use habits trackers and other visual forms of measurement to make your habits satisfying as it provides you with clear evidence of your progress.

Don't break the chain; try to keep your habit streak alive, but if you miss one, it's ok to try to get back on track as quickly as possible: never miss twice.

Be careful about your progress measurement. Just because you can measure something doesn't mean it's the most important thing.

We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying, use a habit contract, or having an accountability partner to make the cost of violating your promises public and painful.

2. Create a habit contract. Make the cause of your bad habits public and painful.

## Genes

Genes do not determine your destiny; they assess your areas of opportunity, so make sure to choose the habit that best suits you, not the most popular one. It is important to mention that genes do not eliminate the need for hard work, but they clarify it and tell us what to work hard on.

The best way to know your strength is to explore more options every time and exploit when you find the game that suits you the best.

## The Goldilocks: How to stay motivated

The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.

As habits become routine, they become less exciting and less satisfying. we get bored, which means that the greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.

The ability to keep going when work isn't exciting makes the difference. Professional stick to the schedule, amateurs let life get in the way.

The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is we stop paying attention to little errors. Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time.
