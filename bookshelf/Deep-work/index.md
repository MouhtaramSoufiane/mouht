# Summary

The goals of this book are: First, to convince you that the deep working practices are valid. The second is to teach you how to take advantage of this reality by training your brain and transforming your work habits to improve your professional life.

**Deep work :** Professional activities performed in a distraction-free state and concentration that pushes your cognitive capability to its limits. Those efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

**Shadow work:** non cognitively demanding logistical style tasks and often performed while distracted. Those efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

**Deep work hypothesis:** The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare and exactly the same time, it's becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. Consequently, the few who cultivate this skill and then make it take the core of their working life will thrive.

## Introduction :

The fact that technology nowadays helps almost all fields increase productivity by providing tools and automation makes the world a very challenging place for workers.

To succeed in this new economic model, you should have those two abilities :

- The ability to quickly master hard things
- The ability to produce at an elite level in terms of both quality and speed.

Those two core abilities depend on your ability to perform deep work.

> High quality work = time spent \* intensity of focus

The big business trends (communication tools and open spaces... ) today actively decreased people's ability to perform deep work. Even though the benefits promised by this trend( Decrease in serendipity, faster response to requests, and more exposure.) are arguably dwarfed by the benefits that follow from a commitment to deep work ( ability to learn hard things fast and produce at the elite level.)

**Busyness as a proxy for productivity:** in the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back towards an industrial indicator of productivity doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.

In work (especially knowledge work) to increase the time you spend in a state of depth is to leverage the complex machinery of the human neurological reasons maximizes the meaning of satisfaction.

## Rule #1: Work deeply

As we have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as we use it, it essential to learn how to work deeply to maximize our productivity:

- **Decide on your depth philosophy:** Depend on your circumstances; find an approach that makes sense for you.
- **The monastic philosophy of deep work:** Maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligation ( emails, meeting, etc)
- **The bimodal philosophy of deep work:** You can manage to practice deep work with shallow work, but you need to be careful. Deep work will require one day of concentration to make it work.
- **The rhythmic philosophy of work schedule:** Try to create a rhythm for your deep work session: 4 sessions of 30 min as an example daily.
- **Build rituals:** Use a methodology to organize your days.
- **The collaborative is helpful:** deep work didn't mean you can only work alone; in some fields, collaboration would be helpful.
- **Create a shutdown ritual:** set a time to shutdown work and your thoughts about work. Rest is important
- **Execute like a business :**
  - Focus on the wildly important
  - Measure you progress
  - Keep a compelling scoreboard
  - Create a cadence of accountability

## Rule #2: Embrace your boredom

To succeed with deep work, you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distraction stimuli. This doesn't mean that you have to eliminate distracting behaviors; it’s sufficient that you instead eliminate the ability of such behaviors to hijack your attention. The simple strategy proposed here is scheduling internet blocks which goes a long way toward helping you regain this attention autonomy.

- **Schedule dopamine-free days:** Experiment a day without the internet or social media.
- **Productive meditation:** take a period in which you are occupied physically but not mentally - walking, jogging, driving - and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem.
- **Memorize a deck of cards:** Train your memory with card memorization will help you improve your deep workability

## Rule #3: Quite social media

#### The only benefit vs craftsman approaches on selecting tools:

The only benefit approach to network tool selection is that you are justified in using a network tool to identify any possible benefit to its use or anything you might miss out on if you don't use it. The problem with this approach is that it ignores all the negative that comes with the tools in question.

The craftsman approach to tools selection: Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on those factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.

#### Apply the law of the vital few to your internet habits:

The low of the vital few: In many settings, 80% of a given effect is due to just 20% of the possible causes

The strategy requires you to investigate social media tools impact on your key activities you are using to hit your goals.

> Action: Quit social media for 30 days and evaluate your experience

## Rule #4: Drain the shallows

#### Schedule every minute of your day:

Try to schedule your workday as a block of 30 minutes; the motivation for this strategy is the recognition that a deep work habit requires you to treat your time with respect.

#### Quantify every activity’s depth:

To evaluate activities, you can ask a simple question: how long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?

If you have shallow work in your work, ask your boss to eliminate it: the reality is that with little time in your busy schedule, you're actually producing value

#### Finish your work by five-thirty:

This strategy is called fixed-schedule productivity. As you fix the firm goal of not working past a specific time, then work backward to find productivity strategies that allow you to satisfy this declaration.

#### Become hard to reach :

- Make people who send you email do more work
- Do more work when you send or reply to an email
- Don't response
